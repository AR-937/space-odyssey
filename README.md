# A Space Odyssey: Using C++ with SFML

This project is a real-time 3D-like space travel simulation implemented in C++ using the **Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML)**. It renders and animates thousands of stars to create an immersive visual experience, simulating movement through space. Inspired by the climactic scene from the classic space opera, **2001: A Space Odyssey**.

## Features

- **Real-Time Star Rendering**: Renders and animates thousands of stars in real-time using SFML's graphics modules.
- **Depth-Based Effects**: Implements depth-based color effects and motion to simulate the stars' distance and create a sense of movement through space.
- **Configurable Design**: Allows customization of star count, speed, and other parameters through a configuration-based design.
- **Optimized Performance**: Achieves smooth performance at **144 FPS** with **10,000 stars** in fullscreen mode.

## Planned Features
-  **Interactive Controls**: Allow users to control the camera and adjust the simulation in real-time.
-  **Advanced Effects**: Add particle effects, nebulae, and other celestial objects for a more immersive experience.
